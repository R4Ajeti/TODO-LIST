<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
At this point you’ve already had a fair amount of practice using the various techniques we’ve shown you. But we’ve been throwing a lot of information your way, so before we move on we’re going to take a minute to slow down and work on one more great portfolio project.

The Todo List
Todo lists are a staple in beginning webdev tutorials because they can be very simple. There is, however, a lot of room for improvement and many features that can be added.

Before diving into the code, take a minute to think about how you are going to want to organize your project
